The bigger value of the DBUF_SIZE the smaller time. 
The O_SYNC and O_DSYNC are flags of open() system call. These flags are used to specify synchronous I/O behaviour.

O_SYNC : The O_SYNC flag specify that write() system call will be block until all file data and metadata have been written to the disk.

O_DSYNC : It is same as O_SYNC, except it doesnt care whether the metadata is written to the disk. The write() will simply return once all the file data are written to the disk.

Programmer use O_DSYNC instead of O_SYNC to eliminate the need to flush the file inode on a write.
